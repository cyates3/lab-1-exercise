# What I hope to learn in Info 201
 I'm hoping to learn:
- more about informatics and how it is used/implemented 
- why *other people* have decided to major in Informatics

I'm also very interested in learing more about the **R programming language**. I think
it will be interesting to see how it differs from other languages.
